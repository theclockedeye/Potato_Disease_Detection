# 🍃 Potato Leaf Disease Detection

This project is an AI-powered **Potato Leaf Disease Detection** system that helps farmers and researchers diagnose diseases in potato plants from leaf images.

## 📌 Features
✅ Upload an image of a potato leaf.  
✅ AI model analyzes the image and predicts the disease.  
✅ Provides three possible classifications:
   - **Healthy** 🍃
   - **Early Blight** 🌿
   - **Late Blight** 🍂

✅ Responsive user interface with a clean design.  
✅ Image preview before prediction.  
✅ Instant results with a loading animation.

## 🧠 Model Training
The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It classifies images into three categories:
- **Healthy** 🍃
- **Early Blight** 🌿
- **Late Blight** 🍂
